A lightweight client for editing 2da files, specifically intended for NWN, built in Python during a long night and largely vibe coded to achieve proper syntax and regex manipulation.
It features basic text tools, excel-like cell selection and ONLY dark mode. (Well, there are now more color styles but only dark and midnight are valid. If you choose light mode, you are objectively an evil person).
It will (should) maintain exact whitespace format in files that may have irregular spacing. 

It may or may not require python 3.10 installed to run.
