A lightweight client for editing 2da files, specifically intended for NWN, built in Python during a long night and largely vibe coded to achieve proper syntax and regex manipulation.
It features basic text tools, excel-like cell selection and ONLY dark mode. (Well, there are now more color styles but only dark and midnight are valid. If you choose light mode, you are objectively an evil person).
It will (should) maintain exact whitespace format in files that may have irregular spacing. 

It was built and packaged using Frozen. This is not related to me, just a funny coincidence. 

The source code can be run directly with python 3.10. Feel free to recompile it if you are using Linux or other OS that doesn't know what an EXE is. 
It should not require python installed to run, but who knows. 

Read the About inside the program for more insight into what it can actually do.
